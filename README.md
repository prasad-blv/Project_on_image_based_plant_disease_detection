Project on IMAGE BASED PLANT DISEASE DETECTION USING DEEP LEARNING

With increasing population the crisis of food is getting bigger day by day.
During crisis crop diseases are a major threat to food industry, but their rapid
identification remains difficult in many parts of the world due to the
unavailability of the experts and necessary infrastructure. The recent
expansion of deep learning methods has found solution for detection of
various plant diseases.
Using the dataset which contains several leaf images which were taken in
various weather conditions, at different angles. Entire dataset is split into
train and test sets. We do image processing using deep learning on the train
set and we evaluate our trained model on the test set. During the training we
want to get rid of many problems like overfitting and underfitting by make use
of regularization or dropout or by increasing number of layers. This model
may recognize only some diseases because of the limited dataset available,
but we can use this model for detection of any type of disease by providing
the large dataset which contains almost all diseases
